    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Typical of the Cochabamba valley, this dish consists of a piece of beef beaten until it is very thin. 
        It is accompanied by white rice, fried egg, boiled and browned potatoes, plus a raw sauce based on tomato, 
        onion, and locoto. One of the features you’ll notice if you order this is the huge size of the portions.
    </p>
    <p>
        This enormous meal has become a feature of Cochabamba’s nightlife. Because hungry revelers needed an 
        economical late-night snack served in a way they could take away with them, the Trancapecho was born.
    </p>
    <p>
        You may notice that this curious concoction resembles a Silpancho. However, served in crusty rustic bread, 
        it’s known as the “poor son of Silpancho”. Still, it will fill you up just as well!

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>First, cook 1 cup of rice with 2 cups of water on the stove.</li>
      <li>Boil 3 whole potatoes for about 10 minutes. Once cool enough to touch, slice them.</li>
      <li>Massage salt and pepper into the ground beef. Divide the ground beef into balls the size of limes.</li>
      <li>Sprinkle ground pepper onto a pile of breadcrumbs, then roll each beef ball in the breadcrumbs for a light coating.</li>
      <li>Coat each side of the meat with breadcrumbs, and roll flat with a rolling pin on top of the breadcrumbs, flipping when it starts to stick.</li>
      <li>The final thickness should be like a crepe. Roll each meatball out into a sheet and stack the rolled meat sheets on a plate.</li>
      <li>Pan-sear each meat sheet on medium-high, flipping when you see raw pink start to turn brown.</li>
      <li>Stack each finished meat sheet on a plate, then fry eggs individually and brown the potato rounds.</li>
      <li>Top the dish with a salad of tomato, red onion, and green pepper. Dress with a mixture of equal parts vinegar and oil, plus generous salt.</li>
      <li>Put the plate together by layering potatoes at the bottom, then rice, the beef, egg, and finally the salad.</li>
      <li>Prepare a spicy llajwa (sauce) to go with it!</li>
    </ol>
