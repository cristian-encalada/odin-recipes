    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This dish is typical of Cochabamba (the valley region). 
        Well-seasoned chunks of minced meat,  chorizo, fried potatoes, locotos (Bolivian chili peppers), 
        tomatoes, hard-boiled eggs, and sliced onions, all in very generous quantities and served as a snack. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Sometimes it is dressed with a sauce made with beer, oil, vinegar, and llajua (a very hot sauce made with locoto and tomatoes). 
    </p>
    <p>
        This dish is reputed to have been created as a hangover cure and is considered “only for the brave” thanks to the fiery power of the spices.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

      <li>2 lb top round first cut steak (any soft lean beef will do great)</li>

      <li>1/2 cup beer (I used Corona for this recipe but any light beer will work)</li>
      <li>1 tsp white vinegar (for meat)</li>
      <li>1 tbsp cider vinegar (for the salad)</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Peel the potatoes and cut into large wedges.</li>
      <li>Peel the onion and slice in the juliana style (think strips), do the same with pepper and tomato.</li>
      <li>Slice the hot dog in thin slices. Slice the hot dog giving it an edge, we don't want them round.</li>
      <li>Clean the meat and cut into cubes of 2 cm each side; this is very important, we don't want the pieces too small or too big, we want them bite-size.</li>
      <li>Mix the vegetables together and set aside. Once all the ingredients are ready, we start cooking.</li>
      <li>Start by frying the potatoes. You might end up cooking two batches since we want them to cook slowly so they are crispy outside but slightly soft inside. This will help the potatoes absorb the juices.</li>
      <li>While cooking the potatoes, hard boil the eggs and peel them and cut them into wedges or round shapes. I prefer wedges.</li>
      <li>When the potatoes are half cooked, start cooking the meat. Heat 2 tbsp oil in a skillet and when the oil is hot, add the meat. We want to seal the edges and brown them but not burn them. This takes about 5 min.</li>
      <li>Once they are brown, add half of the salt and pepper. If you want, add the cumin and garlic; I like the flavor that this adds to the meat. Reduce the heat to medium-high.</li>
      <li>By this point, the potatoes should be cooked, and in the hot oil, we cook the hot dogs. This step is important. We need to cook the hot dogs for about one minute so they are nicely browned on the edges and crispy. Take to a paper towel.</li>
      <li>Add to the meat 1 tsp white vinegar and 1/2 cup beer and the hot dogs. If you are cooking on an electric stove, you can turn off. If you are cooking on gas, cook for about 1 min. We don't want it to be dry; we just want the alcohol of the beer to be reduced.</li>
      <li>Mix the vegetables with 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar and 1 tbsp vegetable oil, salt, and pepper.</li>
      <li>Serve immediately after the meat is cooked; it is important to serve hot.</li>
      <li>Put one layer of potatoes, add the mix of meat and hot dog and add 4 tbsp of the juices from the pan. Top with the salad and decorate with the hard-boiled egg.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> You can put mayonnaise and ketchup on top. Putting these on the table is a good idea, so it's optional for people to add to the food. The best way to eat it is with <em>llajua</em>(Spicy Bolivian sauce) and pieces of <em>marraqueta</em> (roll) to absorb those juices, and when it gets too spicy, a good beer goes so well with it.</p>
