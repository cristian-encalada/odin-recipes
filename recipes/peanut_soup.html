        <li>4 Yukon potatoes</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white rice</li>
        <li>1 big clove garlic</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp powdered cumin</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>Handful fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>Handful fresh parsley</li>
        <li>Small bunch fresh celery leaves</li>
        <li>1/4 cup peas</li>
        <li>Crusty bread</li>
        <li>Llajua (a fresh hot sauce condiment)</li>
        <li>1 tomato</li>

        <li>Small handful cilantro</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a soup pot 2/3 full of water, add 1 Tbsp salt and beef. Bring to boil and simmer for 1-2 hours (longer for tougher cuts of meat). Keep a lid on to prevent broth from evaporating too much. Skim any fat and foam that rise to the top of the soup.</li>
        <li>While the meat broth is brewing, cut your veggies. Cut carrots lengthwise into 1/4″ thick planks, then crosswise into 1/4″ strips. Dice green and red pepper and onion. Cut green beans on the diagonal. Put the veggies in the soup pot.</li>
        <li>Make a raw peanut puree by blending the peanuts in a blender with about a cup of water until you have a creamy consistency. Add the peanut puree to the soup after the meat has cooked for at least an hour.</li>
        <li>Continue cooking for an hour, stirring occasionally. Mash garlic, 1/4 tsp pepper, and 1/2 tsp cumin in a mortar and pestle. Add to the soup.</li>
        <li>Prep for soup garnishes. Make a bowl of fresh feathery herbs by gathering parsley and cilantro and cutting them toward your thumb with a paring knife. Fry potato strips.</li>
        <li>Make fried potato strips by slicing potatoes into thin strips, frying until golden brown, and salting them.</li>
        <li>Make homemade hotsauce (llajua) by pulsing fresh jalapeños, tomatoes, and cilantro in a blender. Avoid blending on full blast to prevent foaming.</li>
        <li>After peanuts have simmered with the soup for about an hour, add rice. After rice has cooked for about ten minutes, tie a bouquet of celery leaves and parsley leaves with cooking twine and steep in the soup.</li>
        <li>Take meat out of the pot, pull meat off the bone, discard bone, and put meat back in the soup.</li>
        <li>When the rice is cooked, add peas and sprinkle dried oregano over the top. Taste the soup and add salt as needed.</li>
        <li>Serve soup in shallow bowls, sprinkle fried potatoes in the center of each bowl, and add fresh herbs on top. Serve with chunks of baguette and llajua on the table.</li>
      </ol>
